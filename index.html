      <h2 class="reveal">About me</h2>

      <h3 class="reveal">What motivated me to learn to code</h3>
      <p class="reveal">
        Since I was young, I've always been very interested in computers and new technologies. After graduating as an office technician and gaining some work experience in this field, I felt the need to explore another, more creative branch of IT. 13 August 2019 marked a decisive turning point in my studies when I was given the opportunity to join the web developer training course at Becode in Liège. This experience not only confirmed my interest in development, but was also the starting point for an adventure in the world of code.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="reveal">And after Becode?</h3>

      <p class="reveal">
        After my training in web development and an internship, I decided to continue with a bachelor's degree in computer science (application development) at HELMo Campus Guillemins. This three-year course enabled me to improve my web development skills while discovering new essential concepts. I discovered object-oriented programming, in particular using languages such as Java and C#, and acquired skills in relational database management (SQL), in analysing customer needs using tools such as UML and MCD, and in designing software solutions adapted to the specific requirements of companies. These are just a few examples of the knowledge I was able to develop.<br/><br/>This bachelor's degree, which is focused on practical work and the development of IT solutions for businesses, has prepared me to take part in all stages of application creation: from needs analysis to technical implementation, including conception, programming and validation. The importance attached to practical work, which accounts for 65% of the course in the final year, and the internship, have enabled me to familiarise myself with the realities of the professional world and to perfect my skills in creating web, mobile and software solutions.
      </p>

      <h3 class="reveal">What about my soft skills?</h3>

      <p class="reveal">
        In addition to my technical skills, these years of training have also enabled me to develop my soft skills, which are essential in the professional world. I learnt to work as part of a team, particularly during many group projects where collaboration and communication were essential. Time management became a natural skill, as each project was an opportunity to meet precise deadlines. I also improved my ability to manage stress, adapt to the unexpected and communicate effectively.
